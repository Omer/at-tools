**However**, there's now a pretty gui interface! Simply run cascader-gui, and follow the onscreen prompts.

## Functionality ##
- Search for Cascaders on your floor
- Cascade, specifying username and topics.
- Minimize to system tray: you can close the main window and still access all functions from the tray.
- Tray icon blinks when cascading.

## Future functionality ##
- Graphical map of your lab/floor and where cascaders are.

## Screenshots ##
Have a look at the **screens** directory for some screenshots of the program in action.
