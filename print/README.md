*A simple script for finding and using the best printer in Appleton Tower.*

Introduction
------------
Often you will print something in Appleton only to find that the printer is out of paper or toner, or that you are 15th in the print queue. This script wraps the functionality of the `lpr`, `lpq` and the `lprm` commands and extends them to get the best printer for your location. The final goal of this project is to provide a drop in replacement for these commands while adding useful and much needed functionality.
